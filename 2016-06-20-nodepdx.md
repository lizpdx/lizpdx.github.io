## NodePDX 2016

Attending my first [NodePDX](http://nodepdx.org/) and I'm excited so far about the range of topics, and the overall organization of the (un)conference. Super laid back with really excellent coffee from [Seven Virtues](http://www.sevenvirtuespdx.com/) and tasty treats from [Return to Eden](http://www.backtoedenbakery.com/).

The number of women here is impressive, and I just bumped into Michelle who I first met at a [ChickTech](https://chicktech.org/) workshop at New Relic a few weeks ago.

Also the sponsors are super interesting. I met (another) Michelle from Elastic who told me a little bit about [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) - might come in useful at my new gig next week.

Chatting with [Jacob](https://github.com/vigevenoj) about another sponsor, [Losant](https://www.losant.com/), he told me about [NodeRed](http://nodered.org/) and [freeboard](http://freeboard.io/)

Currently listening to [Liz Abinante](https://twitter.com/feministy) jam about [knitting and code](https://speakerdeck.com/feministy/a-foolish-quest-auto-generating-knitting-patterns-with-javascript).
