I'm going to post all my learnings here so as to track them over time, and remind myself of all the amazing things that there are to learn.

For example, this week I learned about [ARGV][argv] which is super useful for passing files into a script from the command line and being able to iterate through them like an array.


Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on getting the most out of Jekyll.
