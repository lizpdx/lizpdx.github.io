Attended the [SFDC][sfdc] user group meetup this morning at the lovely [smarsh][smarsh] offices on SW 6th, for a session on Marketing 101 from [PathtoScale][pathtoscale] - a paid SalesForce app for "revenue performance management" used "to report on lead-to-customer metrics, measure campaign ROI and find optimal formula for customer acquisition success."

Quick preso on the [Lookup Rollup Summaries][lookup] plugin to create a remote site.

* "Rollup information between Lookup relationships not previously possible without writing Apex Triggers"
* "Define rollups using standard UI declaratively, no coding required"






OH "when I was in grad school"
