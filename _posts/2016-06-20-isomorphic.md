2004 - Flickr was all the rage, insta-tagging photos

2004 Ajax
2007 jQuery
2010 nodeJS
2011 BackboneJS
2013 AngularJS, Ember
2015 EcmaScript

nodejs surpasses ruby on rails according to google trends

writing logic in back end, and front end. some is the same. can we run the back end frameworks for the front end too?

when loading a page, not just running gets / posts, running logic to know which gets and posts you need

what if server side just spits out html?

client + server MVC


isomorphic js !== server side rendering

server side render is a SUBSET of isomorphic JS
also includes BUSINESS LOGIC

CRUD parts are the first four steps of "how to draw a horse" - business logic is the small details that complete the picture
