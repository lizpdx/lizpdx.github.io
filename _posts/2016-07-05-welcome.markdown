Iâ€™m going to post all my learnings here so as to track them over time, and remind myself of all the amazing things that there are to learn.

For example, a few weeks ago I learned about ARGV which is super useful for passing files into a script from the command line and being able to iterate through them like an array.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
